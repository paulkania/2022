The notes herein gather only what the author doesn’t already know, and serves more as a series of pointers to the paper, rather than a full-blown summary.

you want throughput? we got throughput
journey started with poon and dryja in 2015
LN ecosystem can be divided in 6 sectors
technical foundation
implementations: LND, C-Lightning, electrum
routing nodes: acinq
node mgmt: umbrel, greenlight
liquidity: bitrefill
Payments, wallets, savings
wallets: breez, strike(el salvador), bottlepay
merchant payments: breez, btcpay
payment cards, saving in btc, btc economy
finance
lightning native: immature 
dual service: bitfinex, paxful
rewards & earnings
fold, tippin.me
gaming & gambling:
zebedee, satoshi’s games
other 
social apps -imaature
ecomm - immature
3rd layer -immature
 giftcards - bitrefill

Lightning use phases (experimenters & early adopters)
jan - july 2018: baby money, experiments
july 2018 to july 2019: more experiments, more robust, less wild west. 
july 2019: no change in channel capacity: steady experimenting y’all.
jan 21 - present (nov 2021) - early adopters; el salvador legal tender.
wallet payment volume growth far exceeding channel capacity growth
sept 14: the 7M paxful users now lightning integrated
sept 23: 186M twitter users can tip via lightning
akin to reddit onchain tipping in bitcoins early years
Projecting S curves for ridiculous growth
90% of el salvadorians will have access in 4 years time.
Potential followers to el salvador
total 850M people, 650M currently unbanked
have poor banking access
high remittance payment
strong dependance on (fraying) USD

Micropayments - they & I am stoked on streaming money. wow.
gaming rewards accounted for 4k tx.vol on 189k tx’s, implying 0.02$/tx.
streaming music, content, betting on plays (gaming)
privately
estimate:700M gaming,video,audio LN users by 2030: assumptions outlined in main-report
& 364T LN-tx per year by 2030
reminder that the internet age: gotta zuckerberg em (mf,break things)
5B internet users, 60B Whatsapp msg/day, 376B emails per day in 2025

pg 14:
the story so far
the throughput problem
pg 15
onchain == radio (expensive broadcast to all nodes) && LN == p2p (efficient unicast to node x via node a,b,c,n).
pg 16
how ln works
creating a channel, layer 2, alice & bob
pg 17 - 19
describing the rube goldberg machine that is lightning payments (bing,bong,boop)
HTLCs prevent node in the chain to keep funds.
pg 20
layer 2 has it’s own set of ledger-books. only channel opens and closes require block-space/chain-space

1.4 pg 21
Aug 2021 - 100k LN users
remember the first couple LN nodes a few years ago (they all hated roger ver, who is now irrelevant :)
17k nodes, 74k unique channels, 3kbtc, ~120M$

pg 22
the first 11 months:
20BTC -> 1104 BTC
andreas brekken (4 medium posts) - accounted for 50% of the network in early exp-phase.
LNBIG does a brekken ~6 months later
still a relevant hub today
Hodlnaut and the torch (it was epic and i wanted it but was still afraid of LN-CLI)
i didnt know/ probably forgot that reid hoffman Paypal COO & LinkedIn Co-founder handled the torch
+ fidelity + iranian (us sanction drama)
282 passes, donated 0.04btc to btc-venezuela
pg 23
fast-forward to 2021 (interim was development times, zebedee, satoshi games, proof of concepts, satoshi.place
2021 growth: 1k to 3k BTC
el salvador: june 5 : the announcement, sept 7: the implementation
it’s kind of unbelievable, i haven’t sure i’ve grokked this reality yet tbh. seems not real, far-fetched.
70k public channels + reminder that there are many private channels
bitmex on Jan2020 said 30% channels private
could be x>30% now
pg 24
fig 20 is awesome
describes a spike in onchain fees followed by a increase in LN channels and a dying off of onchain fees (hopefully not a permanent die-off)
when on-chain fees are steadily low, the incentive to use LN is also lower
counterpoint: ln will always be more user-friendly (confirmations, ux)
pg 25
NEW CONCEPT: block-days saved
sept 2021: LN did ~663k tx, which is 332 blocks, which would take 2.3 days. therefore in sept2021, LN took 2.3 days of pressure off of the chain.
caveat: many of these LN-tx are micropayments, and would be too expensive for the chain, even at 0.01$ fees.
how much pressure relief is ideal? (in 2030 the block days saved will be well more than the days in a month, but will there still be enough chain-traffic to subsidize mining. this is only an issue once block rewards are not appealing enough in themselves.
pg 26
hubs are a convenience, and not strictly necessary, ergo privacy, centralization are non-issues
New concept: cut channels, cut nodes, hovering at 10 and 8% respectively
channels/nodes whos removal would disconnect entirely two parts of the network.
pg 27
measuring node clustering//clique-y-ness
peers are becoming more rational when opening new channels.
low barriers to entry to become a hub (capital, time) also point to centralization being a non issue
pg 28,29 - part 2 - who does the LN ecosystem consist of
repeats the the ecosystem portion of the summary notes

pg 30-31
intro to the technical founders
LN nodes: 87LND, 11C-L, 2Eclair, 0.1other
pg 32
fig 25 is great: public node percentage reachable per extra hop
1hop (to hub: LNBIG)
2nd hop -> 281nodes. 2% of public nodes
3rd hop - 20-40% public nodes
4th - 70-90% nodes
5th onwards there are poorly connected nodes so it is basically and asymptotic fn
“maintaining and managing your own node is still a technical challenge”
channels can have a tendency to bleed out. options are to
close and re-open a channel
use a liquidity service (thor?)

pg 36.
Bitfinex Fig 26. LN dep& withdrawals were for token sums -- 34%tx.count & 0.45%tx.value 
non-controversial opinion(?): LN is still very much used experimentally for most, if not a subset, of uesers
experimenting with derivative markets in LN-natively is happening (LN Markets)

pg 38
fig 28 - LN:chain payment ratio of bitrefill
elsalvador: 90%/ Bresil: 40, Nigeria 30, S.Afrique: 20, downstream:10% 

pg 39 - part 3 - evolution of LN, gradually then suddenly?
private LN company & wallet data tell us
160k easy2use LN-wallets
65k-130k unique e2use wallet-hodlers
(pg 41) - “agg incoming and outgoing tx.values were ~$5M
$ -2.4M payments, 1.8M between wallets, 0.7M incoming tx
count - 43k, 60k, 240k(playing with cents) respectively (fig 33)
pg 40
Node concentration:
US 8.5%, Fr 4, Germ 2.5, Can 2, NL 1, UK .5, Swis 0.4, Sngapor&Ital&Nipon .25
shoutout to nigeria, philippines, bulgaria
pg 41 - appended to pg 39

pg 42
as per the data in pg 39
the payments were mostly trading and privacy services (750k, 736k), gift cards 230k, gamebling 147k, merchpayments 135k, other 413k
pg 43
gaming rewards 188k.tx.c for 4k.tx.$
pg 44
$/tx.count ratio is increasing. excidence for exponential increase.
pg 45 - the futur
